**Breast Cancer Classification Project**
Problem Statement

Breast cancer remains a critical health challenge, demanding accurate and efficient diagnostic tools. This project addresses the classification of 568 breast cancers into two classes, Malignant (M) and Benign (B), utilizing the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset from the UCI machine learning repository. The dataset comprises 30 attributes derived from fine needle aspirate (FNA) images, describing various characteristics of cell nuclei. The primary goal is to develop and evaluate machine learning models to classify tumors based on these attributes.

Tools Used

Dataset: Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset
Classification Models: Decision Tree and Random Forest
Evaluation Metrics:
5-fold cross-validation
Confusion matrix
Sensitivity and specificity
Total accuracy
F1-score
ROC curve
Area under the curve (AUC)
Result

The project employs 5-fold cross-validation to assess the classification performance of both decision tree and random forest classifiers. The comparative analysis aims to determine which classifier offers superior performance in distinguishing between Malignant and Benign tumors. Comprehensive evaluation metrics, including confusion matrix, sensitivity, specificity, total accuracy, F1-score, ROC curve, and area under the curve, will be provided to offer a nuanced understanding of the model performances.

Academic Presentation

The project's findings and results will be presented academically, encompassing the dataset, methodology, employed models, and detailed performance metrics. This academic presentation aims to contribute valuable insights into the efficacy of decision tree and random forest classifiers for breast cancer classification. The information will be of interest to researchers, healthcare professionals, and enthusiasts exploring the application of machine learning in medical diagnostics. The presentation slides or document will be made available in the repository for reference.
