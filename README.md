**Breast Cancer Classification Project**
**Problem Statement:**
Breast cancer remains a critical health challenge, demanding accurate and efficient diagnostic tools. This project addresses the classification of 568 breast cancers into two classes, Malignant (M) and Benign (B), utilizing the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset from the UCI machine learning repository. The dataset comprises 30 attributes derived from fine needle aspirate (FNA) images, describing various characteristics of cell nuclei. The primary goal is to develop and evaluate machine learning models to classify tumors based on these attributes.

**Tools Used**

Dataset: Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset from the UCI machine learning
repository: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+%28Diagnostic%29
Classification Models: Decision Tree and Random Forest
Evaluation Metrics includes:
5-fold cross-validation
Confusion matrix
Sensitivity and specificity
Total accuracy
F1-score
ROC curve
Area under the curve (AUC)

The project employs 5-fold cross-validation to assess the classification performance of both decision tree and random forest classifiers. The comparative analysis aims to determine which classifier offers superior performance in distinguishing between Malignant and Benign tumors. Comprehensive evaluation metrics, including confusion matrix, sensitivity, specificity, total accuracy, F1-score, ROC curve, and area under the curve,is provided in this project to offer a nuanced understanding of the model performances.
